// why they are checked against each other rather than only against 0 and 1. The case that
// motivated this is auto_merge == manual_review: the cap applied to a held-back match lands
// below the review threshold, so the pair is dropped entirely rather than escalated — no
// merge, no review task, and nothing to say a candidate was found.
